### [Compton Scattering Lab](https://bluoq.github.io/Portfolio/Compton%20Scattering%20Lab)
![Experimental%Setup.png](Experimental%20Setup.png)

This lab focused on observing gamma radiation to explore light as both a wave and a particle, in particular the phenomenon of Compton Scattering.
* **Python libraries used:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy
* **Data Taken:** Radiation Intensity (Particle Counts), Channels (Energy keV)
* **Principles/Phenomena Explored:** Inverse-Square Law, Compton Scattering, Attenuation, Particle-Wave Duality
